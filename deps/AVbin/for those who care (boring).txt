(This file assumes your machines & installed OSes are 64-bit. 
 calpol: All of your machines except maybe popsi's are.)

files in 'install this' are the ones that i'm fairly sure are right for each OS for calpol
files in 'probably not this' are the other candidates

Mac: lucky bugger, just double-click the .pkg

Windows: Is your Python 32-bit or 64-bit? It's probably 32-bit.
 If your Python is 32-bit and your system is 64-bit, go to install this/ and copy avbin.dll to C:\Windows\SysWOW64\.
 If Python 32-bit and system 32-bit, go to install this/ and copy avbin.dll to C:\Windows\System32\.
 If Python 64-bit and system 64-bit, go to probably not this/ and run the installer.

Linux: Is your Python 64-bit or 32-bit? It's probably 64-bit, b/c having 32-bit
 python on a 64-bit linux is a massive headache due entirely to the inadequacy
 of linux package management tools.

 So run 'sudo ./install-avbin-linux-x86-64-v10' and hope it doesn't rm -rf / ?
 I haven't tried the script!
