    <h2>
        communication
    </h2>
    <p>
        Pyglet communication occurs mostly in our
        <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pyglet-users">mailing list</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, we have two other announcement mailing lists:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pyglet-issues">pyglet-issues</a>,
            which broadcasts automatic emails from the issue tracker.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pyglet-commits">pyglet-commits</a>,
            which broadcasts automatic mails when a new commit is made to the source.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
        issue tracker
    </h2>
    <p>
        You can use the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pyglet/issues/list">issue tracker</a>
        to report any bug or compatibility issue. You need
        a <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/signup">Google account</a> for that.
    </p>
    <p>
        We prefer the tracker to address discussions on specific bugs,
        and address broader topics of Pyglet in the mailing list.
    </p>

    <h2>
        getting the trunk version
    </h2>
    <p>
        The repository can be found <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pyglet/source/browse/">here</a>;
        it hosts the source trunk, documentation, examples, and development tools.
        You can get the latest version of the code using:
    </p>
    <p class="console">
        hg clone https://code.google.com/p/pyglet/ pyglet
    </p>

    <h2>
        contributing to the source
    </h2>
    <p>
        If you want to contribute to Pyglet, we suggest the following:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Create your own clone in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pyglet/source/checkout">official repository</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Get a local copy of your clone using</p>
            <p class="console">
                hg clone https://code.google.com/r/&lt;username&gt;-&lt;rep_name&gt;/source/checkout
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Commit your modifications and push them to your clone.
        </li>
        <li>
			Open an ticket in the issue tracker describing your change and link the clone/commit. A project member
			will review your commit providing feedback and eventually it will be merged into the official repository.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Alternatively you can also create a patch of your changes and attach it to the ticket.
    </p>

    <h2>
        contributing to the documentation
    </h2>
    <p>
        When asking to include your code in the trunk, check that you have addressed its
        respective documentation, both within the code and the API documentation.
        It is very important to all of us that the documentation matches the latest code and vice-versa.
    </p>
    <p>
        Consequently, an error in the documentation, either because it is hard to understand or because
        it doesn't match the code, <strong>is</strong> a bug that deserves to be reported on a ticket.
    </p>
    <p>
        A good way to start contributing to a component of pyglet is by its documentation.
        When studying the code you are going to work with, also read the associated docs.
        If you don't understand the code with the help of the docs, it is a sign that
        the docs should be improved.
    </p>
