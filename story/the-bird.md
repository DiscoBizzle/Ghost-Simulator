(Bird flies off.)


(... TODO ...)


"WAAAAAAAAAARK!"
(flies over player)
(steals ghost credit card)

Oh no! He's taken my ghost credit card!

Well, technically it's a ghost debit card, but them lot at the ghost bank haven't gotten around to-

"Wark.. 9, 7, 3, 4-WARK!"

I have a really bad feeling about this.

If he ever learns it's 9734 5025 1298 3072, my credit rating is done for.

"WARK.. 3, 0, 7.. wark.."


(... TODO ...)
(... some shit happens which results in the bird flying off ...)


## The cancel

This is a disaster. I should cancel my card completely.

That damn bird isn't around, is it...? 

No, I can't see it anywhere. Ok. Ghost phone, uh, bank, uh...

"Yes hello this is ghost bank. Would you like to cancel your card?"

Uh, yes, how strangely specific of you.

"Please enter the PIN number on your ghost keypad, followed by the ghost hash sign."

Okay, let's see... nuh, nuh, dee, dah. Okay, and the ghost hash sign.

"Thank you for entering the... the.. WAAARK! NUMBER REGISTERED, NUMBER REGISTERED!!!"

Uhhhhh... So... Is it cancelled?

"WAARK!! VERY YES, VERY YES, WARK, NOT REALLY, NOT REALLY. Warkwarkwark. BEEP BEEP **BEEP** _BEEP_. WARK."

Oh dear. Oh **very** dear.
