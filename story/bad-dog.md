# bad dog

(conversation takes place between the Count and the Player character. if count == player just drop this mission...?)

## a manne and a doge

Count: Shit, this fucking dog... Goddamn!

Player: What's up, jack?

Count: It's this damn dog. It's pissing everywhere and making a fool out of me. I could really do with not having this dog here.

Player: It's only a dog.

Count: Indeed, and that is the crux of the problem. 

Count: It's rigged up my ghost-iPhone so that every time I go to pick up the thing and kick seven shades out of it I get a phone call that turns out to just be pictures of this dog looking cute and like something that you would not want to kick seven shades out of.

Player: That is very unfortunate.

Count: Yes! Yes, it is!!!

GOTO ### br0

* The dog... hacked your phone?

Count: Yes, well, it is a **ghost** dog, so all bets are off.

DROP

* How is the phone a problem exactly?

Count: I always check it whenever it rings. It's some of that Pavlovian Training gubbins or whatever. 

Count: I'd put it on vibrate but the tone of this game is poor enough as it is.

DROP

* How much piss are we talking about here?

Count: Gallons. Well, more like a pint. But very spread out. *Very* spread out.

Player: So not so much piss at all.

Count: Well no, but ideally in an indoors location what you are looking for is in fact a complete absence of piss.

DROP

* Why should I help you?

Count: You're a young ghost without your skill tree fully specced out, yes? 

Count: Well, I reckon I can spare a point or two for a young get-goer such as yourself, provided you _go_ and _get_ that dog.

GOTO ### br1

### br1

* I see you have a cage over there.

Count: Ah yes, well spotted. See, I used to have a friend what was a bird and he was in the cage. Now he is not. 

Count: Then this damn dog turned up and I thought this could be the perfect solution. 

Count: Some feathers, a beak; who could tell the difference?

SUB

** I think dogs should be allowed to live as who they are, and not birds.

Count: There are some skill points in it for you. And I promise I'll take him out for w- er, flys regularly.

SUB

** Can we skip the whole cage part?

Count: Oh, I suppose so. I will accept the head of the dog cleanly separated from the body as proof you have completed this quest. 

Count: **Cleanly** separated, mind, I'm not cruel.

DROP

* So what are dogs scared of?

Count: I don't know. Click on him and read the thing, you lazy bugger.

DROP

* Sounds legit. I'll just get on with it, then.

## the doge is dazed

Count: Ah, you got the dog. Good show.

Count: Put him in the thing, then, there's a good boy.

## head of the doge

Count: Ah. So... Ah. Got a bit unfriendly, did he?

Count: Oh well. There are plenty of people and things wandering around here suitable for translarkification. I'll trap one in here again soon enough.

Count: Here's your points.

## schrodinger's doge

Count: Good job. That dog is in the cage alright. Must've been a real intellectual challenge, that one.

Count: Take your points and piss off. Whoopee, I'm eating the good stuff tonight!
