# The Middle Path

some kind of thing where there only seems to be two choices, both unsatisfactory, but a third one appears.... though it's harder and as you get further down you see the complexity of the issue.

i guess the most *obvious* thing to write about would be the whole 'should we kill the afterlife' ghost-sim thing

think i'd rather go for something else.. but what?

just simple conflict seems too straightforward..... some kind of thing that is key to ghost society would be better.
hmm. ok, fine. what do ghosts actually do?
