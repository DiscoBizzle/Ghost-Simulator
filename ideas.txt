TG: This is a really good video game so far! I can't wait to see what those kooks come up with next.
You: I do not think it is a good game. It is a bad game.
TG: No, actually, it is very good.
You: I disagree.
TG: Then we will have to agree that you are wrong.
You: No.

TG: By following my instructions, you too can bask in my success.



Ghostpeople. Gheeple.

WAKE UP SHEEPLE

it implies that sheep are shleepy, of which i have seen NO evidence



TG: The mass of a coconut is inviolable.

TG: Put the coconut on the switch, but carefully; the mass of a coconut is 
    inviolable.

TG: Lamentable coconut! O hark, thy mass is inviolable.



+=+=+ limes and lemons +=+=+

TG: Woah, woah, woah! Watch where you put the citrus!

TG: Putting the citrus is an honored task.
.
TG: Did you enjoy putting the citrus? I remember when I put my first citrus.
    Not where, though, admittedly.

TG: Move the citrus with care. It is a delicacy.



+=+=+ TUTORIAL +=+=+

TG: Oh, ghostliness. Very ghosty.
TG: It's really important when you're a ghost to do, uh, scary shit.
    So you should totally go ahead and do that.
TG: Oh! Look. There's some kind of a NON-ephemereal being over there.
    Do him. Go on: do him.

...

(encouragement, if necessary)
TG: Come on. He's not that scary. I know this is all new to you, but if you
    just go over and pull his pants down I promise you'll feel a lot better.

...

(more encouragement)
TG: Do it. Do it! Do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it.
    Do. It.

...

(further encouragement still)
TG: Everyone thinks you're really scary. Buck up man, come on. You can do this.
    We can do this. Together.

...

(more encouragement)
TG: Unless you're literally retarded, you should have figured it out by now.
    You're just baiting me for lines. I'm flattered, but really, let's just
     get the fuck on with it now. I'm a busy man.

...

(actually walked near man)
TG: See how he's freaking out like a motherfucker? Wow! This is pretty crazy.
TG: He's afeared of you. You are translucent, so you can see where he's coming
    from.

...

(second man)
TG: Because this is a video game, you have to do something new now.
TG: I know. Wasn't standing slightly too close to people enough of a challenge?
TG: I can't be fucked with all of this old-school bollocks. Just let me creep
     people out and I'm set, like, you know?
Someone else: Get on with it!
TG: Fine, fine, fine. I read the contract, I know what I have to do.
TG: Ok, so, right, the deal with this guy. He's not scared of you just being
     near him.  Go on, try it.

.

TG: See? He doesn't care. Maybe he doesn't know what's good for him. Maybe
     he's just dumb as hell. Maybe he was Timothy Leary's dealer in a past 
     life, and his visual field is all just auroras at this point.
TG: In any case, it's your job to scare him straight. Go stand near him and
     go blaaaaghaalalalagaahaalaalagh or something. Push a box on his 'ed
     or rub his genitals against a cheese grater. I don't know; do him in!

...

(after scared second man)
TG: Nice one, probably. I mean, I've seen better, but at least you're trying,
     and I guess that's what really matters.
TG: Now let's go see victim number 3.

.

(encountering victim number 3)
TG: Now this guy is only scared of *specific* shit. You'll be dealing with a
     lot of these people, thanks to the marvelous desensitization machine
     that is the internet.
TG: To fuck this one over good and proper `like` we need to get a bit more info.
TG: Click on him if you've got a mouse, or if you plugged in a controller
     because you're actually a child who finds the interface afforded by
     a Tonka toy more natural then press the appropriate button. It'll be B on
     a 360 pad, or circle on a PS3 controller.

...

(displaying dialog)
TG: Right, now you can see what the deelio is with this character. 
TG: Some borderline slanderous background, followed by what amounts to a text
     dump from some dank dark region of the game engine. Emphasis on 'dump'.
TG: This dubious scenario has been engineered so that you'll need to possess 
     that skateboard over there and ram that paperclip into the earth pin
     of the mains.
TG: You can possess stuff by getting near it and pressing the F key (F `here of
     course` standing for 'fuck him up') or the A button on a 360 pad
     or X on a Sonything.
TG: This will result in a really bad day for the guy.

...

(you did it!)
TG: Well, brutal murder achieved, and you're less than a minute into the game 
     proper. Man, this video games is some good shit!
TG: On a more practical note, I'd get out of there unless you want Eau de
     Involuntary Bowel Movement stuck to the inside of your nostrils for the
     rest of your ghost career.

...

TG: To the gaaaaaaaaaaaaaame!~
