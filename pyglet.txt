Sprite cheatsheet:

from gslib import sprite

Instead of pygame Surfaces, you want to use gslib Sprites.
Instead of composing images onto a surface then blitting that surface,
 the idea is to load textures ahead of time and make use of the numerous
 Sprite* properties to achieve what you want to render.

Sprites are much much much faster than Surfaces, as (almost) everything you
 can do becomes an OpenGL instruction somewhere and mighty hardware does it.

gslib Sprites are almost the same as pyglet.sprite.Sprite, with two changes
 to make life easier for us.*

'Drawing' rectangles
====================
If you want to draw a rectangle, call graphics.new_rect_sprite() and stash
 the result somewhere. This returns a new Sprite with a 1x1 white rectangle
 texture set, from which you can make any rectangle as follows:

You can colour the sprite by changing sprite.color_rgb or
 sprite.color_rgba. (sprite.color_rgba just sets sprite.color and sprite.opacity
 at the same time in one go.)

You can resize the sprite by setting sprite.scale_x and sprite.scale_y.
By default we resize from the top-left corner, but you can change this using
 sprite.anchor settings (see pyglet docs).

You can move where the sprite will appear by changing sprite.x and sprite.y,
 or if both then sprite.set_position().

You draw the sprite by calling sprite.draw(). Adding it to one of the game
 *_objects_to_draw() lists will also result in it being drawn.

Do not worry about sprite batching for now.

Sprites from images
===================
You can make a sprite of a given image by doing:
 sprite = sprite.Sprite(pyglet.image.load('image.png').get_texture())

The above may be replaced by a function in graphics for efficiency reasons
 (cache textures).

*** DO NOT *** create a new texture every frame! This will leak video memory.
(Textures are NOT automatically cleaned up just because your python code
 stops caring about them. Manual deletion is possible.)

Creating a new Sprite every frame or calling graphics.new_rect_sprite() every
 frame is OK if unnecessary. graphics.new_rect_sprite() caches its texture
 and Sprites are lightweight. It is the .get_texture() call that would leak.

(* changes: color_rgba and color_rgb instead of just color (rest of pyglet
    used rgba except for Sprite), and scale_x and scale_y instead of just scale
    which makes it possible for us to render arbitrary rectangles from a 1px
    texture.)


2. Text rendering cheatsheet

*** TODO *** (see todo list. we have text rendering, but it's not very
 convenient right now & no easy way to get rendered width & height)


3. TODO list

- graphics.draw_objects
- graphics.draw_map
- graphics.draw_character_stats
- graphics.draw_game_over
- graphics.draw_fear_bar
- graphics draw_circle (or drop it)
- graphics.draw_torch (drop draw_circle, use image of circle?)
- graphics 'view of field' option
- graphics.draw_text_box
- text rendering (a Sprite derivative would be ideal. watch texture garbage 
                   collection!!)
- port all input code (joy.py, key.py, mouse.py, menus.py, ???)
- port all sound code
- port cutscene stuff inc. graphics.draw_cutscene
- port maps.py test()
- character.py: info sheet
- credits.py port
- game.py port (gulp)


Doing spritesheets:
Look in pyglet docs & see if built-in support is suitable.
If not, port our support and make use of TextureRegions.
(You can change the texture of a sprite cheaply, and you can set it to
 be a sub-texture by asking for the region of a texture.)

- pygame.Rect port (i.e. check license is ok then copy Rect into gslib)
