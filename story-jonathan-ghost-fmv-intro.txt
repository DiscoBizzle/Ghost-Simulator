ghost tosses and turns in ghost bed

shot of a load of other ghosts pointing and laughing next to him;
 "hahahahahahah" then one guy goes "stupid dickhead" really audibly
  and jarringly

(narration starts:
 "This is the story of Jonathan Ghost, just an ordinary ghost boy doing
   ghost boy things and being bullied by ghost bullies.")

he wakes up and walks around his ghost house a bit, before rifling through
 letters in porch to see a piece of mail
"Having woken up, he meanders pointlessly around his ghost house for a bit,
 before discovering a new letter in his, er, inbox"

"He opens it. It is ghost post telling him (in invisible ink) that he's the
 winner of a competition he never even entered.
 He almost throws it away, until he sees the magnitude of the amount of ghost
 money this lucrative opportunity, l-offers.

 'No more will the ghost bullies do their ghost bullying thing!', he thinks.
 'I can _pay_ them to stop!'

 He quickly sets on his way."

"Darkness. He has arrived in the cavernous halls of the ghostly competition
  mansion. Compemansion.

 The door swings shut and locks behind him. He sees real people from the real
  world, everywhere. He hopes none of them will bully him."

Real people (same as ghosts but without sheets) point at Jonathan Ghost
 and start laughing at him. 'Hahahahahaa' then one guy goes 'stupid dickhead'
 really audibly and jarringly.
